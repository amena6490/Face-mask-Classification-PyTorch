### This code is tested on PyTorch==0.4.1

## What is Treansfer Learning ?

In reality, very few people train the entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization) because it is fairly difficult to have a data set of adequate scale. Alternatively, it is popular to pre-train ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which includes 1.2 million images with 1000 categories) and then use ConvNet either as an initialization or as a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest.
